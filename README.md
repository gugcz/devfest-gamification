# DevFest gamification
We created a very successful gamification platform for DevFest 2013.

Features:
- attendees get achievements for various tasks on the conference and go up in the leaderboard
- attendees can see their progress on the mobile website after they sign-in with a Google account
- organizers are granting achievements with special Android app either by scanning NFC badge or a QR code on the badge which contains attendee's G+ profile URL
- progress and teasers are shown during session brakes in session rooms

## mDevCamp 2014
We have modified the platform for conference mDevCamp 2014 this way:
- it doesn't use G+ accounts+NFC+QR codes, we replaced it with simple auto complete for attendee's name

You can see the modified code in the `mdevgame` branch
